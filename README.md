**Question 3
Library Management System**

**Description :**
You are tasked with building an enhanced Library Management System in Java. The system manages different types of items in the library, such as books, DVDs, and magazines.  Each item has common attributes like title, author/creator, a unique identifier, and a status indicating whether it is checked out or available.

Boiler plate code implementation of base class : LibraryItem and its subclasses : Book ,DVD and Magazine, and a generic class Library representing the library are given. 

The enhanced system introduces the ability to check out and return items. Exceptions are used to handle scenarios where an item is already checked out or not checked out when attempting to return it.

The code starts with the main class EnhancedLibraryManagementSystemwhich contains the main method to execute the Library Management System.

**Question 4
Hashmap**

Write a java program to remove an element from the Map, you can use the remove() method. This method takes the key value and
removes the mapping for a key from this map if it is present in the map.
Instruction- before running the program , give 4 string inputs and then the one  integer number which key you want to remove.
keys should start from 1.

**Output-**
Mappings of HashMap are : {1=sakshi, 2=kiran, 3=prashant, 4=kevon}

**Question 5**
**Target Sum**
Rohan is given a task two return indices of pair whose sum will be equal to the given target.
Only one such pair is required.

**Input Format**
size of the array
array elements
target

**Output Format**
index pair whose sum is equal to the target

**Input** 
4
2 7 11 15
9

**Output**
(0 , 1)

**Explanation**
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9


Mappings after removal are : {1=sakshi, 2=kiran, 3=prashant}
